# WauxLang

WauxLang - A language that compiles to WASM bytecode.

This is currently an experimental language/compiler targeting WASM as it's runtime.

Compiler is written in F#.

Current goal: get a simple language compiling and running in WASM
Current language syntax: N/A

Should I use this? No.

Why Waux? What does that word mean? How do you pronounce it?
  * Pronounced like the English work "walk" [1](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/wauk)
  * "A Scots word for wake"
  * Why Waux?
    * Overall, I just needed to call it something.
    * But wanted something starting with Wa- to match Wasm, and it wasn't that bad of a word.
